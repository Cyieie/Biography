    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    </div>
    <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Hello, my name is <strong>Cyrus Songodanan</strong>, 21 years old and from Pasig City.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I was born
        on <b>December 18, 2003</b>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> I have so many childhood experiences, such as always playing 
        outside the house and having happy friends who are still with me today.<b><sup>3</sup></b> Being a child is 
        one of the times I would like to go back to because there were no problems to think about, 
        and all we did was play.<b><sup>4</sup></b> We had strict parents, but they were also the reason why my 
        childhood was happy.<b><sup>5</sup></b> My parents always told me as a kid to be more sociable so I could 
        make good friends, and because of that, I met many people, some of whom remain my 
        friends to this day, while others are no longer in my life.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I still remember how my parents 
        would scold me as a kid because I wouldn’t take afternoon naps and would just keep 
        playing outside.<b><sup>7</sup></b> Aside from being scolded, my parents also had a sweet side, like the time 
        they gave me my first guitar, and my older sister taught me how to play it.<b><sup>8</sup></b> This sparked my 
        love for playing the guitar, which I still enjoy today.<b><sup>9</sup></b> It wasn’t just a guitar they gave me; 
        they also gave me a bike.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I remember always biking with my friends at a park near our 
        house.<b><sup>11</sup></b> I really enjoyed my childhood days because I got to try all kinds of sports and 
        activities.<b><sup>12</sup></b> I played basketball, volleyball, and badminton.<b><sup>13</sup></b> These are things I still enjoy 
        doing because I genuinely love these activities.<b><sup>14</sup></b> Christmas is also one of the best parts of 
        my childhood memories because it was the time I saved up a lot of money.<b><sup>15</sup></b> Aside from 
        money, I also received different toys and items from my godparents.<b><sup>16</sup></b> I will never forget all 
        my childhood experiences because they became the foundation of who I am today.<b><sup>17</sup></b>

    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
    </div>
    <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Of course, my teenage years were also wonderful.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I explored many things about 
        myself.<b><sup>2</sup></b> When I was in grade 9, I started playing the guitar again, but I wasn’t very focused 
        because I had difficulty playing the songs I liked.<b><sup>3</sup></b> However, during the lockdown, things 
        changed.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I was so bored at home and had nothing to do except play online games and 
        attend online classes, so I focused on playing the guitar.<b><sup>5</sup></b> I tried playing a song every day 
        until my fingers got used to handling the guitar.<b><sup>6</sup></b> During that time, I developed a stronger 
        love for singing and playing music.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I also discovered that I could sing, even if just a little.<b><sup>8</sup></b> 
        When I was in grade 11 at UE Manila, I joined the Music Aficionado club, and thanks to 
        them, I learned how to play music even though it was all online.<b><sup>9</sup></b> I often joined their 
        activities to expose my skills and gain the experience I needed to grow.<b><sup>10</sup></b> One of the happiest 
        moments before I joined this club was when they made me play a song I didn’t know.<b><sup>11</sup></b> I 
        spent a week learning it and tried my best to join the club.<b><sup>12</sup></b> All the hard work was worth it 
        because I made it into the music club.<b><sup>13</sup></b> My teenage experience didn’t end there, though.<b><sup>14</sup></b> 
        Before I graduated, we had our prom, and I was one of the performers on stage with my 
        friend.<b><sup>15</sup></b> I became even more passionate about playing music as many of my fellow students 
        sang along with us while we performed, and the feeling was amazing.<b><sup>16</sup></b> With every 
        performance, I learned to become more confident in myself and love the things I do.<b><sup>17</sup></b> 
        With the help of my friends and mentors in Music Aficionado, I became happier expressing 
        myself through music.<b><sup>18</sup></b> I can’t count how many songs I learned in this club, and with each 
        song, I learned to trust my abilities.<b><sup>19</sup></b> In the end, music became my inspiration to keep 
        growing and dreaming, not just in this art but in my life as a whole.<b><sup>20</sup></b>

        <h2>College Life</h2>
    </div>
    <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        My college experiences are not that hard yet because I have many friends who help 
        and support me through the challenges of college life.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I know that college isn’t easy, and 
        you need friends who will stand by you through the hard times and the happy ones.<b><sup>2</sup></b> Right 
        now, I have friends who never leave me even when we’re all struggling; we fight together 
        for our future.<b><sup>3</sup></b> My love for music still remains strong during college life.<b><sup>4</sup></b> Since I started 
        college, I joined the UE JAM SESSION, and that’s where I experienced performing on 
        stage with people watching us.<b><sup>5</sup></b> We have a band called 'Da Binsi,' and we have two 
        vocalists, with me playing acoustic guitar.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I didn’t just join a music club in college, but I 
        also became a member of an organization called Comsso, and currently, I’m one of the 
        officers.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I’ve met many upperclassmen because of the clubs, and now they provide ideas 
        and guidance for my upcoming college journey.<b><sup>8</sup></b> They guide me in what I should do and 
        what I shouldn’t.<b><sup>9</sup></b> I feel blessed to be surrounded by people who care about my growth and 
        success.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I also try my best to share the knowledge I’ve gained with others, so we can all 
        help each other.<b><sup>11</sup></b> Despite the pressures of college life, these experiences make it all 
        worthwhile.<b><sup>12</sup></b> I know that the friendships I’ve built and the lessons I’ve learned will shape 
        who I’ll become in the future.<b><sup>13</sup></b> Sometimes, we have late-night talks about our dreams, 
        which make me more motivated to push myself forward.<b><sup>14</sup></b> Even though college can be 
        overwhelming, having my friends and the right support system makes it manageable.<b><sup>15</sup></b> 
        Every new challenge becomes an opportunity to grow, and I’m excited for what lies ahead.<b><sup>16</sup></b> 
        I’m also starting to see the importance of balancing both my academic and personal 
        passions.<b><sup>17</sup></b> The skills I’ve gained in music, along with my academic pursuits, will help me 
        build a future I’ve always dreamed of.<b><sup>18</sup></b> In the end, college isn’t just about the degree; it’s 
        about finding yourself, making lasting memories, and learning how to face life’s 
        challenges with confidence.<b><sup>19</sup></b>
